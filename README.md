Simple C Chatbot

A basic chatbot implemented in C that responds to simple user inputs with predefined messages.

Features

Recognizes common greetings and questions.

Case-insensitive input handling.

Removes unnecessary newline characters.

Exits the chat when the user types "bye".


How It Works

1. The user types a message.


2. The chatbot converts it to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.


3. It checks for keywords and responds accordingly.


4. The chat continues until the user types "bye".



Installation & Compilation

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/c-chatbot.git
cd c-chatbot

2. Compile the Code

Use GCC (or any C compiler) to compile the program:

gcc chatbot.c -o chatbot

3. Run the Chatbot

./chatbot

Example Usage

Chatbot: Hello! Type your message (type 'bye' to exit).
You: Hi
Chatbot: Hello! How can I help you today?
You: How are you?
Chatbot: I'm just a bot, but I'm doing great! How about you?
You: What is your name?
Chatbot: I'm a simple chatbot created in C.
You: Bye
Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a great day!
